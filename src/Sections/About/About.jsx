              Hello! I'm Govinda, a passionate MERN stack developer with a
              recent BTech degree in Computer Science and Engineering,
              complemented by a diploma. As a fresher, I bring a strong academic
              foundation and practical experience gained from a 6-month
              internship focused on MERN stack development. During my
              internship, I honed my skills in: Frontend Development: Creating
              responsive and dynamic user interfaces using React.js, and
              managing state with tools like Redux. Backend Development:
              Building robust server-side applications with Node.js and
              Express.js, ensuring efficient API integrations and secure
              authentication systems. Database Management: Designing and
              maintaining scalable database schemas with MongoDB to support
              complex web applications. I am dedicated to leveraging my skills
              to build innovative and user-friendly web applications. My
              internship experience has provided me with hands-on knowledge and
              the confidence to tackle real-world projects. I am eager to join a
              dynamic team where I can contribute my fresh perspectives and
              continue to grow as a developer. Explore my projects and feel free
              to reach out if youâ€™re interested in collaborating or learning
              more about my work.
